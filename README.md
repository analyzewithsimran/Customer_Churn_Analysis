This analysis provides key insights into the factors driving customer churn in the telecom dataset. The overall churn rate is 26.54%, indicating that about one-fourth of customers are leaving the service.

Customers with shorter tenure (1–2 months) and those on month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn, suggesting that longer-term plans enhance retention. Senior citizens and users paying through electronic checks are more likely to churn, highlighting potential dissatisfaction or payment convenience issues.

Moreover, customers without internet-related services such as OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, and OnlineBackup tend to leave more often. Fiber optic users also display higher churn compared to DSL users, possibly due to pricing or service quality differences.

In conclusion, to reduce churn, the company should focus on improving engagement among new users, offering incentives for long-term contracts, enhancing service support, and bundling internet-related features to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
